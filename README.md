# NxNextJsMicro

## Commands

- `nx run <app-name>:dev` (run nextjs app)
- `nx serve <back-end>` (sample app `login-api` app)
- `nx reset` (resets cache)

### Starting new NextJS App
https://nx.dev/nx-api/next
1. Install `@nx/next` to your NX workspace.
```bash
nx add @nx/next
```
2. Create NextJS Application
```bash
nx g @nx/next:app apps/your-app-name
```

### Creating library directory

- `mkdir lib`
- `nx g @nx/next:library ui --directory=lib`

### Creating component directory

- `nx g @nx/next:component auth-component --project=lib-ui`

## Prettier
Add `prettier` command to specific project (`project.json`):
```json
{
  "targets": {
    "prettier": {
      "executor": "nx:run-commands",
      "options": {
        "command": "nx format:write --projects ui"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
### How to run (either of these 2)
- `nx run prettier:<app-name>`
- `nx prettier <app-name>`

## Deploy to Server (e.g. Vercel)
- Set the `build command` to:
```bash
npx nx build <app_name> --prod
```
- Set the `output directory` to:
`apps/list/.next`

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Nx plugins and code generators

Add Nx plugins to leverage their code generators and automated, inferred tasks.

```
# Add plugin
npx nx add @nx/react

# Use code generator
npx nx generate @nx/react:app demo

# Run development server
npx nx serve demo

# View project details
npx nx show project demo --web
```

Run `npx nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [code generators](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code) and [inferred tasks](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks) in the docs.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
